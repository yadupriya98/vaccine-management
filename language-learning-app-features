Basic Principles of creating a Language Learning Apps 


Provide two way communication with the users

The primary thing you ought to do while developing a language learning app is consider the means for motivating and collecting user feedback. You ought to have an option for your course to be reviewed not only within the Google Play/App Store markets but also directly within the application itself. This is often the foremost direct thanks to improve your service, and provides you the chance to seek out why that or another user didn't bring their learning process to a logical conclusion. Note that such a functionality should be very simple in its implementation (like a pop-up window that doesn't require any links or manipulations with the keyboard), in order that your students, leaving feedback about the appliance, go along the trail of least effort.

Only use Proven learning Resources 

You can provide your app with an in depth list of varying language courses, but it doesn't mean that those among them would be helpful. If there is one mistake, the users will lose interest in your app. So don’t reduce the standard of the presentation just because your application allows for remote training. On the contrary, create something which will make people choose your application over traditional and tested offline courses.

Focus on fast learning

One of the biggest reasons people choose online learning, rather than traditional learning, is the lack of time. That's why your app to find out languages should be focused on the fastest possible achievement of the specified results. People have come to understand that, if they devote a brief period to studying (the less the better; as practice shows, a typical apprentice wishes to watch first results after 2-3 weeks), they're going to be ready to make significant progress in their knowledge of the chosen language. That's why it's very desirable to provide separate sorts of courses within the application - which, providing the utmost loads during a short time, are ready to teach students the required basics. 


Create an online community 

Any teacher with sufficient professional experience will tell you that, so as to extend the strength and effectiveness of the learning process, students should be given the chance to intercommunicate. That's why an integral part of any learning app should be a student forum, during which students are ready to discuss lesson topics and exchange opinions associated with the organization and structure. It is the procedure to provide a platform for the user, where they can communicate openly.

 Develop the option for Live streaming 

A great thanks to increase the interest during a learning app is the introduction of live group video conferences with real teachers. Such a method will surely increase the extent of confidence in your teaching methodology. Also by that the learners can increase their confidence level. and can make the method of self-study more interesting and exciting.
